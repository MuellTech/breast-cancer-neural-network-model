# Breast Cancer Detection with Machine Learning

## üöÄ Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project harnesses the power of **machine learning** to create an accurate, reliable, and interpretable model for detecting breast cancer based on clinical and diagnostic data.

## üîç Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive analysis of diagnostic features for patterns and insights.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for robust detection.
- **Evaluation**: In-depth evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Clear and interactive visualizations of model performance and feature significance.

## üìä Dataset

This project uses the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)), which contains 569 instances and 30 numerical features derived from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

### Features:
- **Radius**: Mean radius of nuclei
- **Texture**: Mean texture of nuclei
- **Perimeter, Area, Smoothness**, etc.

### Labels:
- **Malignant (1)**: Cancerous
- **Benign (0)**: Non-cancerous

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and encoding
   - Splitting into training and testing sets

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Distribution plots for key features
   - Boxplots to identify outliers

3. **Modeling**:
   - Algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.
   - Feature selection for improved interpretability.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, AUC-ROC
   - Cross-validation for reliability

5. **Results Visualization**:
   - Feature importance ranking
   - Performance comparison across models

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Libraries**:
  - Data manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine learning: `scikit-learn`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment

## üìà Results

- Achieved an **accuracy of 96%** with the best-performing model.
- Visualized key features contributing to model predictions, aiding interpretability.
